# Superstore Data Analysis

This repository contains the steps and scripts used to upload a CSV file into a MySQL database, alter the data types, add and update columns, and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) from the data.


## Introduction:

This project demonstrates how to handle and analyze data from a superstore dataset using MySQL. The steps include uploading the CSV data, modifying the table structure, and performing data analysis to derive insights.

- Create the Database
- Load Data using MySQL Workbench Wizard
- Altering Data Types
- Adding and Updating Columns
- Analyzing KPIs
1. Total Sales and Total Profit
2. Correlation between Sales and Discount
3. Finding Cost and lot more.

Please go through the SQL Script which I have attached.

## Challenges Faced:

Working with the superstore dataset presented several challenges:

1. Date Columns: The Order Date and Ship Date columns were initially in text format, and converting them to date format was tricky. The original format was mmddyyyy, which required careful handling to ensure correct date conversion.

2. Large Dataset: Analyzing a dataset with 10,000 rows can be computationally intensive and required efficient querying to obtain results in a reasonable time frame.

Despite these challenges, the data was successfully transformed and analyzed to derive meaningful insights.


## Conclusion

In This project demonstrates how to upload, manipulate, and analyze data in a MySQL database. The steps provided can be used as a foundation for more advanced data analysis and reporting.
